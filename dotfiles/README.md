List of all my dotfiles
=======================

This repository contains all my dotfiles for the difference OSes.
(I should probably be using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage them?)

MacOS setup
------------

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to manage packages.
- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) for terminal.
- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) for zsh + plugins.
- [Yabai + skhd](https://cbrgm.net/post/2021-05-5-setup-macos/) for window management.
